SPECI (A Computational Tool for Speciation Study)
-------------------------------------------------

SPECI is a graph-theory-based tool designed for speciation studies in coordination chemistry. By integrating 2D graph enumeration, 3D embedding, and automated microkinetic modeling, SPECI enables the exploration of diverse assemblies—including coordinating solvents, oligomers, and interacting ion pairs—without relying on predefined bonding templates.
